This project was just for fun and so that I could practice JavaScript. I enjoyed working on it and tapping into my fantasy-loving side, but I did have to have some help coming up with fully whimsical ideas. I was inspired to do this project by the Monthly Codex challenge for April so it's a little overdue but who cares. I am still working on it and you may see that I have some blank spaces for stuff I want to add.
